current project in development
I attempt to create a python script to extract firewall rules from Juniper SRX device
The format extracted from JUNOS will be in JSON format and then it will be re-formatted to display in HTML tables.
I have developed some basic functions to just display the rules in HTML table. If anyone interested, please add more functions to it.
